# polygon_drawing_application

This application consists of a hierarchy of Java classes with methods for drawing and obtaining properties of shapes such as the area and perimeter of circles and N-sided polygons. 

For more details on the implementation, please see the polygon_drawing_app_report.

It also consists of additional methods for drawing a bounding rectangle for an object in the class hierarchy and another method for detecting whether two objects in the class hierarchy overlap.
